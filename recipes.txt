INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large sweet potato (about 3/4 to 1 pound), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes

Classic traditional thanksgiving stuffing
https://www.averiecooks.com/classic-traditional-thanksgiving-stuffing/
INGREDIENTS
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, divided
1 pound day-old white French bread, diced into 1/2-inch cubes and dried
1 extra-large (about 2 1/2 cups) sweet Vidalia or yellow onion, diced small
1 1/2 cups celery, diced small
2/3 cup Italian flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely minced
1/4 cup fresh sage leaves, finely minced
3 tablespoons fresh rosemary (sticks discarded), finely minced
2 tablespoons fresh thyme (sticks discarded), finely minced
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon pepper, or to taste
2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided
2 large eggs
INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat oven to 250F. Place cubed bread on a baking sheet and bake, stirring occasionally, until dried out, about 45 minutes. You must begin with very dry bread or it’ll turn to mush. Tip – To save time on the day of, bake and dry out the bread the night before and leave uncovered on the counter uncovered until the morning you’re ready to make the stuffing.
When you’re ready to make the stuffing, transfer bread to a very large bowl; set aside.
Preheat oven to 350F and spray a 9×13-inch pan or 3-quart baking dish with cooking spray; set aside.
To a large skillet, add 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter and heat over medium-high heat to melt.
Add the onions, celery, and cook until vegetables have softened and are just beginning to lightly brown, about 10 minutes. Stir frequently. Transfer vegetables to bowl with bread.
Add the parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, 1 1/4 cups chicken broth, and toss well to combine; set aside. Note about salt – the saltiness level of low-sodium chicken broth varies, and so do personal preferences, so salt to taste.
To a small bowl, add the remaining 1 1/4 cups chicken broth, 2 eggs, and whisk to combine. Pour mixture over bread and toss well to combine. Turn mixture out into prepared baking dish.
Dice the remaining 1/4 cup (half of 1 stick) butter into 8 to 10 pieces and evenly dot the butter over the top of the stuffing. Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 40 to 45 minutes, or until top is as lightly golden browned as desired. Serve immediately. Stuffing is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 5 days. Reheat gently as desired.

- oven staling dried it out too much; after air staling the stuffing was nice and mushy
- fresh herbs was much better
- made again for thanksgiving 2020, turned out OK. vegan this time
    - chicken broth -> veg broth
    - butter -> vegan butter
    - egg -> simmered shredded apple abomination that was supposed to be apple sauce (+ cinnamon)
- don't forget to watch when it's uncovered so that it doesn't burn

Honey garlic salmon
INGREDIENTS
4 wild caught salmon fillets about 1/2 pound or 250 grams each, skin off or on
Salt and pepper, to season
1/2 teaspoon paprika (mild, sweet or smokey)
2 tablespoons butter
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or minced
4 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon water
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice, (plus extra to serve)
Lemon wedges to serve

Add the salmon steaks to the sauce in the pan; cook each fillet (skin-side down if there's any skin) for 3-4 minutes or until golden, while basting the tops with the pan juices. Season with salt and pepper, to taste (if desired).
Optional -- Add the lemon wedges around the salmon (adds a stronger lemon taste). 
Baste salmon one more time then transfer the pan to your oven to broil / grill for a further 5-6 minutes, or until the tops of the salmon are nicely charred, and the salmon is cooked to your liking.
To serve, drizzle with the sauce and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve with steamed vegetables; over rice or with a salad.

- small pan keeps the salmon submerged in the sauce


Dan Dan noodles
see https://thewoksoflife.com/dan-dan-noodles/

- don't overcook noodles / rinse them in cold water after, or they stick together
- lao gan ma was a good substitute for chili oil, but didn't give the same mouth tingle as making it from scratch
- sub peanut butter for tahini; recipe calls for a *lot* of oil which you can go lighter on (if using lao gan ma, a few tbsp was good)


Lamb stew
see https://natashaskitchen.com/lamb-stew-recipe/

- did in the slow cooker for ~5 hours. meat was almost *too* tender and bacon lost flavour. maybe don't cook as long if using slow cooker


Thai curry sweet potato lentil soup
see https://www.fromachefskitchen.com/thai-red-curry-sweet-potato-and-lentil-soup/
and https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/green-curry-lentil-soup

- red lentils turn to mush; add much later if using them
- sweet potatoes take a while to cook
- for green curry, fresh bamboo shoot was a great addition (canned stuff didn't taste as good)


Honey garlic shrimp
see https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/quick-healthy-dinner-20-minute-honey-garlic-shrimp/

- easy and tastes great. careful not to burn the pan though


Stuffed peppers
see https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a23014857/classic-stuffed-peppers-recipe/

- tasted great, not the best choice for feeding several people

- dried out very quickly; don't overcook


Slow cooker kimchi stew

Indian chicken curry (murgh kari)
see https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/212721/indian-chicken-curry-murgh-kari/

Chicken Xacuti
see https://www.daringgourmet.com/chicken-xacuti/

- result tastes awesome, but it takes a lot of work to find spices, toast them, blend them
- substitutions: coriander seed -> ground coriander (~same amount), carom -> thyme, mace -> nothing
- spices might toast better without the ground spices included
- using mortar and pestle was difficult for cinnamon + star anise (maybe they needed to be toasted longer?)
- the step where you put everything in a food processor was very tedious with a magic bullet
- tamarind doesn't really separate much in the pan; maybe pre-separate it


Harvest chicken casserole
see https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a55760/healthy-chicken-casserole-recipe/

Southern style sausage stew
see https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/sausage-recipes/southern-style-sausage-stew/

- cook sausages on low to avoid burning the pan


Chicken soup
see https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/the-best-chicken-soup-recipe/

- when making stock, too many sweet veggies (carrots, onions) makes it too sweet. supposedly adding other veggies (or the non-edible parts like the stems) can give it a more balanced flavour
- tried adding rotini with red lentils. turned out well but the pasta needs much more time than the lentils to cook, so adjust accordingly

Bombay chicken
see https://kravingsfoodadventures.com/bombay-chicken/

- not like hakka style, but still tastes great
- need to visit an Indian grocer for curry leaves


Mushroom risotto
see https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/85389/gourmet-mushroom-risotto/

- takes a while
- can add shrimp and/or parmesan (but don't overdo the parmesan)

    - corn for some sweetness
    - spinach for greens

see https://www.food.com/recipe/chicken-parmesan-19135

see https://www.koreanbapsang.com/kimchi-soondubu-jjigae-soft-tofu-stew-kimchi/

- taste felt flat; maybe it needed extra flavouring or some veggies


Butter chicken (murgh makhani)
see https://www.recipetineats.com/butter-chicken/

- added extra tomato puree + yogurt; ended up liquidy and more like a chicken curry than butter chicken
